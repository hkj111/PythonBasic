    "## 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "re.compile() returns regex object\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "They appears so that backslash do not have to be escaped\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns match object\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "We get it using group() method\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 0 contains the entire match, Group 2 covers the second set of parameters and Group 1 covers the first set of paraenthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be escaped using backslash\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "If regex contains group it will return list of tuple which contains strings and if it does not have group then it return list of strings\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "It signfies either matching 'either' 'or' between two groups\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The character \"?\" means match zero or one of the preceding group\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "The * matches zero or more whereas the + matches one or more\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The single 4 matches only 4 instances whereas 4,5 matches instances between 4 and 5\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here \\d matches single digit , \\w matches single word , \\s matches single space\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\\D matches single character which is not a digit, \\W matches a single character and \\S matches a single space \n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here \".\" performs a greedy match and \".?\"  performs a non-greedy match\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "\n",
    "[a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "In re.compile() if we pass re.IGNORECASE as a second argument\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \".\" matches any characters excpet new line character and when we pass re.DOTALL as 2nd argument in re.compile() the \".\" now matches new line character also\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "\n",
    "X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "It allow us to add whitespace and comments to the string passed in re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "## '42'\n",
    "## '1,234'\n",
    "## '6,368,745'\n",
    "## but not the following:\n",
    "## '12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)\n",
    "## '1234' (which lacks commas)\n",
    "\n",
    "re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$')\n",
    "\n",
    "## 21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that ## the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the ## following:\n",
    "## 'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "## 'Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "## 'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",
    "## but not the following:\n",

How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second ## word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? ## This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
