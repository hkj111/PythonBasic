    "### 1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "These sqaure brackets signifies list in python. When we do type([]) it returns list. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Value is 'd'. as '3'*2 will return '33' and then it will be converted into integer 33/11 is 3 which is already integer so spam[3] therefore it returns 'd'\n",

    "### 13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Tuples and list are both used to store elements however the both differ List are mutable whereas tuples are not mutable which means we can delete elements from list add element in between but we cannot do the same to tuple as it is an immutable object\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We can just typecast them list1=tuple(list1) first list1 was [1,2,3,4] after typecasting it is (1,2,3,4) similarly we can do it for tuple to now list1 is a tuple lets make that list again list1=list(list1) this will convert that tuple into list now we have list1=[1,2,3,4]\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they\n",
    "contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "They contain the value of that element and become whatever type of element is list holding at that particular index. For example list1=[1,2,3,4] if we do a=list1[2] now a contains integer type value 3.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When we use copy the refrence of object is copied into the other object thus making it vulnerable to changes meaning that if the object  changes in the copied object , the  original object also changes whereas when we use deep copy the original object are also copied thus changing object dosen't affect the original objects\n",
